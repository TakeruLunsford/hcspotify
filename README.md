***THIS PLUGIN NO LONGER WORKS!***
Unfortunately, Spotify updated their Windows client and no longer puts the song title in the title bar of the window, where this plugin grabs the now playing info from. 

Spotify Now Playing plugin for HexChat
======================================

This plugin outputs your current playing song in Spotify to the channel.

### Installation
Download the .dll from the `bin` directory. Use `hcspotify.dll` if you are using 32-bit HexChat, or `hcspotify_x64.dll` if you are using 64-bit HexChat. Put it in `%APPDATA%\HexChat\addons` (or wherever you like. Keeping it in `%APPDATA%\HexChat\addons` will keep the addon between HexChat updates). In HexChat go to Window > Plugins and Scripts..., then click Load and select the .dll.

### Usage
`/spotify`

### Example output
    ` * rahatarmanahmed is now listening to: Arion â€“ Cold Blood & Ice Cream Cones`
